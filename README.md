# About me
With all the knowledge I have accumulated in the previous semester and my projects, I look forward to having the opportunity to challenge myself and gain more experience in a practice environment by participating in practicality and highly applicable projects related to fields such as data science or data analyst. During this opportunity, in a short time, I hope to apply all my experiences studied in this professional environment to real projects
